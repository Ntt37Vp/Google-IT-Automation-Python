# Course 3 - Git & Github
# Week 1

# Before VCS
# DIFF 
# example:
# DIFF file1 file2
# -u flag shows a unified format
# DIFF -u file1 file2
# wdiff shows the words difference
# the DIFF output could also be redirected into a .diff file
# format:
# DIFF -u file1 file2 > change.diff

# .diff can be manually worked on OR automate using PATCH command! 
# to use the PATCH:
# PATCH target_file < fix_file.diff

# Here comes VCS
