# Debug issue

# ./start_date_report.py
# nano ~/start_date_report.py
# fix the get_start_date() func by type casting int()

# Improve performance
# To check the execution time of a script, use the time command
# ex:
# time ./start_date_report.py
# Go to get_same_or_newer() function line

# Download the file only once from the URL.

# Pre-process it so that the same calculation doesn't need to be done over and over again. This can be done in two ways. You can choose any one of them:

# To create a dictionary with the start dates and then use the data in the dictionary instead of the complicated calculation.
# To sort the data by start_date and then go date by date.
