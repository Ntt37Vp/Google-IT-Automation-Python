# Course 2 - Week 5 - TESTS

# Software testing is a process of evaluating computer code to determine whether or not it does what you expect it to do.

# Simple Tests
# Manual vs Automated Test
# test cases

# Unit Tests
# the most common type, for small, isolated parts of code

# use the FROM keyword in interpreter
# from filename import function_name
# use the UNITTEST module
# use the TestCase class
# class TestRearrange(unittest.TestCase):
# def test_basic(self):
#     testcase = "Lovelace, Ada"
#     expected = "Ada Lovelace"
#     self.assertEqual(rearrange_name(testcase), expected)
# unittest.main()
# don't forget to add the unittest.main() in the unit test file

# adding different scenarios
# EDGE cases -- are inputs to our code that produce unexpected results, and are found at the extreme ends of the ranges of input we imagine our programs will typically work with


# Other Tests Concepts
# Black Box vs White Box (transparent)
# Smoke Test
# Test Suite
# Load testing verifies the behavior of the software remains consistent under conditions of significant load.
# Regression test -- Regression testing is a type of software test used to confirm that a recent program or code change has not adversely affected existing features, by re-executing a full or partial selection test cases.
# Test Driven Dev (TDD)

# Errors & Exceptions
