# Course 2 - Week 5 - TESTS

# Software testing is a process of evaluating computer code to determine whether or not it does what you expect it to do.

# Simple Tests
# Manual vs Automated Test
# test cases

# Unit Tests
# the most common type, for small, isolated parts of code

# use the FROM keyword in interpreter
# from filename import function_name
# use the UNITTEST module
# use the TestCase class
# class TestRearrange(unittest.TestCase):
# def test_basic(self):
#     testcase = "Lovelace, Ada"
#     expected = "Ada Lovelace"
#     self.assertEqual(rearrange_name(testcase), expected)
# unittest.main()
# don't forget to add the unittest.main() in the unit test file
