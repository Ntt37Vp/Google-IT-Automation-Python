# Course 2 - Week 4 - Managing Data and Processes

# Data Streams

# input() function gets user inputs

# I/O Streams
# STDIN
# STDOUT
# STDERR

# A shell is a command line interface used to interact with your operating system.
# Bash is the default Linux shell
# using env command to check Environment Variables
# echo $PATH
# /usr/sbin/temp is NOT listed by default

# using the OS module
# using SYS module
import os
import sys
import subprocess


# print("Home: " + os.environ.get("HOME", ""))
# print("SHELL: " + os.environ.get("SHELL", ""))
# print("FRUIT: " + os.environ.get("FRUIT", ""))

# The .get method is quiet helpful

# using the export command to save an ENV VAR
# export FRUIT=Pineapple
# when the script is ran again, the Banana env var will show


# Command line arguments --  parameters that are passed to a program when it started.


# print(sys.argv)
#  The list of arguments are stored in the sys module.
#  exit status is a value returned by a program to the shell

#  to check the EXIT status using $?
# echo $?

# WC command prints out the number of lines, words and chars in a file
# exit status codes
# 0 - success
# 1 - failed


# In Python 3

# Input handles string as a generic string. It does not evaluate the string as a string expression.

# raw_input doesnâ€™t exist, but with some tricky techniques, it can be supported.

# eval() can be used the same as Python 2.


# Python Subprocesses

# use the .run method to run a linux system command
# example, to run "date" command enter
subprocess.run(["date"])
result = subprocess.run(["sleep", "2"])
print(result.returncode)
# result2 = subprocess.run(["ls", "showfile.txt"])
# print(result2.returncode)

# capturing the output using
# capture_output = True
# result3 = subprocess.run(["host", "8.8.8.8"], capture_output=True)
# print(result3.returncode)
# print(result3.stdout)  # This prints out a byte array b' data
# print(result3.stdout.decode().split())

# advanced subprocess management
# Using the copy method
# my_env = os.environ.copy()


# Learn more about the Subprocess management module in
# https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html


# Practice Quiz
# What type of object does a RUN func return?
# > CompletedProcess

# How can you change the CWD where a cmd will be executed?
# > use CWD param

# When a child process is ran using Subprocess module which of the ff is true
# Child runs in a secondary env
# Parent process is blocked
# Control is returned to parent???

# When using RUN command in Subprocess module what param is set to True to allow output of system command?
# capture_output

# What does COPY method of OS.ENVIRON do?
# Creates a new dictionary of environment variables ??


# PROCESSING LOG FILES
# check out the example check_cron.py script
